        Physics is the study of energy in all its guises. Beginning with the astronomy of antiquity, marching through the philosophical schools of Classical and Hellenistic Greece, 
        and maturing in the Middle Ages in the Arab world, physics took its modern form near the turn of the 16th century with the arrival of Galileo, who firmly put science on an 
        experimental footing and insisted that Nature had a vote. Indeed, his ball-rolling ramps were "a distant ancestor of todayâ€™s particle accelerators". Yet it was Isaac Newton 
        (1643-1747) who marked a definitive turning point in natural philosophy. It was his Principia, Book III that laid out the <i><b>scientific method</b></i>, second nature to anyone of 
        empirical bent. Thus, we are all Newtonians. Following his law of universal gravitation -- an astonishing feat of unifying dramatically disparate phenomena -- Newton dreamt 
        of a similar comprehension of <i><b>all</b></i> of Nature in terms of as few mathematical principles as possible.
        <br/><br/>
        Today, that which we call "fundamental physics", also going by the names of "particle physics" and "high energy physics" (for it takes the highest energies to resolve the 
        smallest sizes), is the ongoing quest to realize Newton's dream. It is a quest that struck serious success in the 19th century in the development of electromagnetism and 
        thermodynamics, and in the 20th via the appearance of quantum mechanics and Einstein's theories of special and general relativity, culminating -- through an avalanche of 
        discoveries -- in the formulation of the Standard Model, the best fundamental theory yet to describe all of creation. Yet the Standard Model is plagued by gaping holes and 
        puzzling peculiarities, leaving practitioners of fundamental physics plenty to plumb even as new insights continually challenge our understanding of the cosmos we inhabit.
        <br/><br/>
        We, at the Centre for High Energy Physics at the Indian Institute of Science, are dedicated to making and spreading knowledge of fundamental physics through Humboldt's ideal 
        of uniting research and teaching. Our faculty consists of 14 highly accomplished physicists, whose diversity in expertise enables us to mount a multi-pronged attack on 
        Nature's deepest mysteries. They imbue their zeal for research and discoveries in students of all denominations, training and mentoring them so they may embark on scientific 
        adventures of their own. To do this at a world-class level while being equitable and inclusive of mentees from all socioeconomic backgrounds is of great priority to us.
        <br/><br/>
        Research at CHEP, as mentioned, is manifold. We study the Standard Model at high precision, such as unveiling the properties of the strong nuclear force under extreme 
        conditions. We also address the pathologies of the Standard Model by exploring physics beyond it. This endeavour is part phenomenological, with the aim of discovering novel 
        effects at ongoing and future experiments, in accelerator, astroparticle and cosmological environments. A large fraction of effort goes into unmasking dark matter, the 
        enigmatic invisible substance that makes up five-sixths of all matter, shaping cosmic structure. It is also part experimental, via analysis of data collected at the CMS 
        experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Finally, it is part formal, via examining mathematical aspects of quantum field theory, such as developing new techniques 
        to compute Feynman integrals or exploring the principle of holography. Here our quantum gravity group confronts the problem of wedding gravity to quantum physics and 
        illuminating the structure of the Standard Model. In addition, we also specialize in applications of methods developed in quantum theory in such varied settings as condensed 
        matter physics, quantum computing, and black hole entropy.
